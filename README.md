### Dear visitor,
I am currently teaching myself methods for interpreting language models and focusing on technical problems that increase the likelihood of positive outcomes of machine intelligence.

Previously, I was the founding engineer at [SketchPro.ai](https://sketchpro.ai/), where we built generative image tools for architecture. Before that, I studied Computer Science at Middlebury College and grew up in Maine. 

Beyond my laptop, I've spent time racing [bikes](https://bjar.substack.com/p/unbound-200), building simple [projects](https://www.benjamin.ar/work), [writing](https://www.benjamin.ar/substack), and [designing](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bqv5nvYHZtc/) [posters](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Nef1eFaRd/).

Cheers,

Benjamin

I am meditating on:
* Is there a better way to surf the internet? What if you want to learn about a singular topic? How do you navigate the sea as a novice traveler?
* How do we build personal technology to help everyone get the most out of their tools?
* How much to we allow technology to shape our education systems?
